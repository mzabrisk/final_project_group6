        <h3>The challenges and limitations  </h3>
        <li>Defining the Assumptions </li> 
        <li>Normalizing Data </li> 
        <li>Filling Holes in Data</li>
        <li>Does Data Lead to predictability, Pitfalls of the Solution</li>
        <h3> Assumptions</h3>
        <p> The assumptions are that Cigarette smoking, and CO2 levels 
            are direct factors in the risks associated with Death From Lung Cancer. 

        <h3> Normalizing Data</h3>
        <p>The primary outlier was the data for the United States.</p>

        <img src="static/images/Co2Rates.jpeg" alt="CO2_rates">
        <div id= "plot3"></div>


        <p> One of the challenges we ran into is that the areas we used to select were too large. 
          For example in the United States the data was generalized to the entire country. 
          Cancer rates vary from state to state. This leaves to many other factors not accounted for 
          in the specific countries. </p>
          
        <p>The data sets were small for many of the countries around the World which 
          limited the effectiveness of the analysis, resulting in all countries not being included. </p>

        <h3> Filling Holes in Data set</h3>
        <p>The data set with the most wholes in it was the GDP data set.  We thought it was important to include 
            because it may possibly show a link between cancer rates and the wealth of a country. The countries 
            that had missing data, had data missing at the head or tails of the data set. 
            Providing a trend and forecasting backwards was challenging and may have significantly biased the data. 
            Looking at the information using the GDP data with the minimum, maximum, and average values included 
            for the blank values, it was determined that there was less bias using the minimum GDP as it would lease 
            likely over estimate the wealth of the country. Using the Minimum values appeared to produce the least bias in the data as it did 
            not show the country to be more productive than it was at its minimum points.
        </p>

        <h3> Additional Data Needed</h3>

        <li>Information on rates of cancer</li>
        <li>Life expectancy for cancer patients</li>
        <li>Availability of treatments for cancer</li>
        <li>Is it a cultural or healthcare phenomenon.</li>

        <p><br>In the end it was determined that we would need to corelate the long term concerns of CO2 and cigarette smoking 
          and corelate the average life expectancies per country to determine when the effect of the environmental factors 
          were directly or indirectly corelated to the Lung Cancer Death Rates.
