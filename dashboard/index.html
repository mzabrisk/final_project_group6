              <h3>How are CO2 emissions and cigarette sales linked to lung cancer rates?</h3>

              <p>
                Although it is well known that smoking cigarettes does in fact cause lung cancer, we wanted to find out if CO2 emissions is also a player in this
                worldwide disease. Our group found 3 data sets obtained from kaggle to get us started in finding this question out. We used a Lung Cancer Deaths 
                CSV, a cigarette sales CSV, and a CO2 emissions CSV all shown in the reference tab above. As we began cleaning, sorting, and studying our data, 
                we quickly found out that we needed to bring in some other datasets to tune in our model for predicting lung cancer death rates. Some questions we 
                found ourselves asking through the analysis were; are there more lung cancer cases in men or women? Does country GDP play a factor? What countries have
                the highest emissions? How has the data changed throughout the last 20 or so years? Overall, it was clear that cigarette sales do indeed play a critical
                role in lung cancer cases. The data shows that the more cigarettes sold, the more cases recorded. Over the past 20 years, cigarette sales have gone down 
                resulting in lung cancer rates to go down, but the emissions in most countries are continuing to rise! It's hard to say for certain if CO2 emissions is 
                directly related to lung cancer, but that was the point of this analysis. To find out if we could create a model for predicting lung cancer deaths in people
                exposed to not only cigarettes, but CO2 emissions as well.
