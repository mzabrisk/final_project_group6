# Lung Cancer, C02 Emissions, and Country #

## Overview of Analysis ##
This analysis is based on 4 datasets obtained from kaggle. The Lung Cancer deaths CSV (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/programmerrdai/cancer?select=lung-cancer-deaths-per-100000-by-sex-1950-2002.csv) contained 4,572 rows of information on country, year, death rates per 100,000 for females, and death rates per 100,000 for males. The cigarette sales CSV https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/programmerrdai/cancer?select=sales-of-cigarettes-per-adult-per-day.csv contained 2,767 rows of data including country, country code, year, and sales of ciegarettes per day per adult average for the year.

### Purpose of Analysis ###
The purpose of the analysis is to determine if cigarette sales and C02 emissions are linked to lung cancer.  

## ETL Process ##
The data was combined into a database. We used both the Pandas Library in Python and PostgreSQL to clean, sort, and merge our data to a state where we could use it for our visualizations and Machine Learning Models.

## Dashboard
We created a webpage to portrey our findings through visualizations and using the mapbox API. The webpage has different tabs of information, with the first giving a background of our analysis, the second utilizing the mapbox API showing countries CO2 emissions, the third gives references to our data sets we are using with a clickable link to read about the data, and the final tab
